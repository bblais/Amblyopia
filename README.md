# Amblyopia
This repository is for materials around the simulation of synaptic plasticity as it applies to amblyopia.  The code here uses:

1. https://github.com/bblais/plasticnet
2. https://github.com/asdf-format/asdf
3. https://github.com/bblais/Python-for-Science


I hope to get rid of some of the dependencies, but until then it will remain a bit messy.


Presenting at the [ARVO 2022](https://arvo2022.arvo.org/agenda) meeting.  [Poster session here](https://arvo2022.arvo.org/meetings/3GHWLKLLwcg77Swfm).
