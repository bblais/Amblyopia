# Amblyopia
This repository is for materials around the simulation of synaptic plasticity as it applies to amblyopia.

The code here uses:

1. https://github.com/bblais/plasticnet
2. https://github.com/asdf-format/asdf

The image database is too big for GitHub, but can be downloaded from the following link: https://mega.nz/folder/W7oQQDpS#gWbsw98d9nAfL7cOkcLo8g


I hope to get rid of some of the dependencies, but until then it will remain a bit messy.
