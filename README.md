# Amblyopia
This repository is for materials around the simulation of synaptic plasticity as it applies to amblyopia.  

The Poster can be found here:  https://github.com/bblais/Amblyopia/raw/main/ARVO%202022%20figures/ARVO%202022%20Poster%20Final.key.pdf

Some old BCM animation can be found here: https://github.com/bblais/Amblyopia/tree/main/Animation





The code here uses:

1. https://github.com/bblais/plasticnet
2. https://github.com/asdf-format/asdf
3. https://github.com/bblais/Python-for-Science


I hope to get rid of some of the dependencies, but until then it will remain a bit messy.


Presenting at the [ARVO 2022](https://arvo2022.arvo.org/agenda) meeting.  [Poster session here](https://arvo2022.arvo.org/meetings/3GHWLKLLwcg77Swfm).
